Title: Experimental Open Hardware soldering iron station controller PCB

Price: $7

Description:

Hardware hacking is more fun with open source, DIY tools. That's why <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=2457">Arhi designed</a> a completely <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Soldering_Iron_Driver">open soldering station controller motherboard</a>. 

The completed PCB is the heart of a soldering station, able to control several types of name-brand (and clone) soldering iron pencils. The key to this universal design is the analog front-end which is capable of reading both thermocouple and PTC temperature sensors commonly used in most soldering irons.

Tip status is monitored by a mircrocontroller, and accurately adjusted via PID temperature control. Temperature, configuration, and calibration settings are shown on a 2x16 character LCD display, and controlled with rotary encoder knobs. Soldering pencils currently tested by the community include Hakko, Solomon irons, and Weller PES51 irons. See a full list of <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Soldering_Iron_Driver#Tested_soldering_irons">tested soldering pencils</a>.

<b>Features:</b>
    Compatible with most PTC or TC type soldering irons
    Accurate and adjustable PID temperature control
    Potential for USB data logging, and firmware updates
    UART/serial data logging
    Uses a HD44780 2x16 character LCD
    Low noise, zero crossing AC heater control
    Dangerous Prototype's version is public domain (CC-0)

This is just a PCB. You will need to source parts, a transformer, and most importantly a suitable fuse.

<b>WARNING</b>: This PCB is intended to be used with hot pointy things and dangerous voltages. This is a community developed board, copies are available to interested experimenters. NO SUPPORT OR WARRANTY IS AVAILABLE WHATSOEVER. This project is not recommended for anyone.
